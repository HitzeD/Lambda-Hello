Name: Dakotah Hitze

Bemidji, MN but from Lafayette, IN

I served 4 years in the U.S. Air Force. I separated in 2016 with an amazing wife, and two beautiful children.

In my downtime, you can either find me on my laptop, or watching whatever DC Comics has put out new!

Three words decribing me are: Storng-Willed, Confident, and Shy!
